# AirBnB clone project! (The Holberton B&B)

First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration...

Each tasks are linked and will help you to: - put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances - create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file - create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place...) that inherit from BaseModel - create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage. - create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine


## Syntax
The AirBnB works by using commands given by the user input.


### List of useful commands
* `cat` - prints and concatenates files to the standard output
* `cp` -copies a file into another file
* `grep` - helps to search for a file in a specific pattern
* `less` - will let you go backward and forward in the files
* `ls` - will list all files and directories in current working directory
* `mv` - helps to move one file into another file
* `pwd` - given you the current working directory


### Builtins
There are two builtins programmed into the shell. Below is a description and use for each builtin.


### Exiting commands and the shell
To exit out of a command or process the user can use `ctrl c`. `Control c` stops a process and causes it to abort.
The user can also utilize the command `ctrl D` which will just exit. When the command `ctrl D` is used an exit status of 0 is given. Using exit, you can input its exit status or it is defaulted to the status of the last command executed.
